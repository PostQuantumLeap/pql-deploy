THE ENVIRONMENT CONTRACT — every setting the app receives, in one place.

⚠ A VALUE THAT IS NOT NAMED HERE IS NOT REACHABLE. This is the bug class
`docker-compose.yml` shipped twice: `config.py` read `ENGINE_VERSION` from the
environment and INSTALLATION.md documented it as a thing an operator sets, but
compose never listed it, and compose passes only the names it lists — so the
fleet-wide engine rollback lever could not be pulled at all, with no error to say
why. The same happened to the whole SCAN_* group. Both were found by running the
drill, not by reading the file.

Keeping every name in one template is what lets a test enumerate them. See
`values-registry` in the chart README.

  editing the bootstrap ConfigMap is not enough: the pushed config overwrites it

  Passkeys (v3.4 Wave 5, spec §9). rpId and origins are rendered VERBATIM,
  with no `default`: `default` treats an explicit "" as unset, and an
  explicit "" RP ID is the kill switch. Nothing is derived from ingress.host —
  a derived RP ID would switch passkeys on at the next upgrade and move
  silently with a rename.

  rpName is the exception, because it is not a switch: the app refuses to
  boot unless it is 1-64 characters once trimmed (app/config.py), so an
  explicit "" or a blank name rendered as written crash-looped the pod
  (release review M1). It is trimmed and falls back to the app's own default,
  which is what leaving the variable out would give.

  Read with `dig`, not `.Values.config.webauthn.*`. `helm upgrade
  --reuse-values` (deploy/KUBERNETES.md) feeds a release its OLD values, not
  this chart's defaults, so a release installed before these keys existed has
  no `config.webauthn` map and direct access fails the upgrade with a nil
  pointer. `dig` falls back only when the KEY is absent, so an explicit "" RP
  ID is still rendered as written (scripts/ci/assert-chart-refusals.sh
